<H2><b>Overview</H2></b>
EcoPLOT was developed to faciliate the exploration and study of multivariate, biogeochemical datasets. EcoPLOT is organized into three modules (Environment, Plant Phenotype, and Amplicon), each featuring a variety of statistical and graphical tools unique to each data type. Below we explain how to properly format your data for upload into EcoPLOT and highlight some of the unique features of our tool. For module specific instructions, please consult the guides at the front of each section.  
  
<H2><b> Formatting Your Data For Upload  </H2></b>
EcoPLOT currently accepts **.csv** , **.tsv**, and **.xlsx** file formats.  
  
The Amplicon Data module accepts **.biom** and **.qza** file formats in addition to those previously mentioned.  

The first column of each file uploaded to EcoPLOT should have the first column reserved for sample ID's (see below). This requirement does not apply to tables in **.biom** or **.qza** formats. These file formats should not be altered.  
  
Example datasets are included in each module.  
  
  <b>Example table format:</b>    
  
|sampleID  |      |treatment    |depth    |replicate    |
|--------  |---   |---------    |-----    |---------    |
| RE_100   |      | control     | B       | 2           |
| RE_110   |      | drought     | C       | 1           | 
| RE_227   |      | drought     | C       | 2           |
| RE_119   |      | control     | A       | 4           |
| RE_147   |      | drought     | C       | 1           |
| RE_117   |      | drought     | A       | 4           |
  
  
  
<H2><b>Interactive Exploration of your Data</H2></b>
  
EcoPLOT enables the discovery and creation of novel variable groupings. This feature, titled dynamic selection, allows for the creation of up to 10 unique variable groupings. This tool can be used to distinguish outliers or to create groupings for samples that exhibit clustering not explained by existing variables within your experimental design. All variables created this way can be accessed within plots or statistical tests.  
  
This feature is available in **scatter** and **Ordination** plots found across the three modules. 


  
  
<H2><b> Logging Information </H2></b>
  
  Each time EcoPLOT is launched, a log file is created that captures the filters applied and the results of statistical tests across the course of your session. The title of the file consists of a timestamp from the time at the begining of your session followed by the word EcoPLOT, **timestamp_EcoPLOT.log**.  
  
Logged steps can also be viewed in the R console.
