### Launching EcoPLOT

EcoPLOT can be run on local devices. Simply clone the app folder from [EcoPLOT's Github](https://github.com/cdsanchez18/EcoPLOT). 
NOTE: Running EcoPLOT locally requires the most [up to date version of R](https://cran.r-project.org/) to be installed on your local device. This will also require a stable internet connection. 

The following code will launch EcoPLOT automatically on most systems. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("shiny") 
shiny::runGitHub("EcoPLOT","CDSanchez18")
```
