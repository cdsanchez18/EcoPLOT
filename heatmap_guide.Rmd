# Heatmap Operating Guide

## Overview 
The heatmap function in EcoPLOT taken from the Phyloseq package and utilizes ordination methods to organize columns and rows. Because it utilizes a distance matrix, rendering times may vary depending on the size of your dataset.  

This visualization is an effective tool to visual ecological data and was first described in a 2010 article in BMC Genomics.
